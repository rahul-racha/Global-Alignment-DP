# Global-Alignment-DP
Implementation of Global Alignment Dynamic Programming Algorithm using Affine-Gap Penalty.
## Problem Description
The input to your program involves two DNA sequences, a gap score for opening a new gap, and a gap score for extension of a gap, a score for a match and a mis-match respectively. The output includes the three matrices F(I,j), Ix(I,j), and Iy(I,j), the optimal alignment score, and the optimal alignment.

## *__Requirement__*
